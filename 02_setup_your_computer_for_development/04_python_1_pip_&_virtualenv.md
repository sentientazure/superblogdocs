### What is `pip`? Why do we need it?

pip is a package-management system used to install and manage software packages written in Python. We're using it to install various things, including Django itself. pip is a recursive acronym for "Pip Installs Packages". ([learn more about pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/))

### Installing `virtualenv`

If you don't already have virtualenv installed, run the following command to install it:

```bash
$ pip install virtualenv
```

We're using it to create a virtual environment for our Django project. ([read more about virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/))
